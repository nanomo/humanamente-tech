# RFC-0001: Core Architecture

## Overview
The system is built from deterministic steps, contextual inheritance, and dimensional operations.

## Principles
- Nothing occurs outside steps.
- Nothing exists without context.
- Nothing evolves without process.
- No decision exists outside dimensions.

## Structure
- Seed
- Dimensions
- Processes
- Steps
- Patterns
- Observability

## Non-Goals
- Centralized control
- Hard determinism
- Immediate optimization
